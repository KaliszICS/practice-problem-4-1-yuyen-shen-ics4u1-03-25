# Instructions  

  1. Create a Rectangle class:

It should have _length_ and _width_ as its two instance variables.  They should be doubles<br>
Create a constructor that takes in the length and width and sets them from parameters.<br>
Create getters for all instance varaibles.	<br>
Create two methods, _area_ and _perimeter_ which will return the the respective values as doubles.<br>


  2. Create a Circle class

It should have a _radius_ as its instance variable<br>
Create a constructor that takes in the radius and sets it from a parameter.<br>
Create getters for all instance varaibles.<br>
Create two methods, _area_ and _circumference_ which will return the the respective values as doubles.  Use 3.14 as PI.<br>

  3. Create a Person class

It should have _name_, _age_, _height_, _weight_, _eyeColour_, and _hairColour_ as instance variables<br>
_height_ and _weight_ should be integers.<br>
Create a constructor that takes in the each of the instance variables and sets them from parameters.<br>
Create getters for all instance varaibles.<br>
